Clue_app_Flask

## What is it?

ClueLogic is a web app to accompany the game Clue: Master Detective. It uses python code to track players' guesses and derive useful information from them, helping you figure out whodunnit, where, and with what faster than the other players.

Yes, this is sort of a cheating app. Your Clue: Master Detective games may not be as fun if you actually use this app. That's okay because it's not really the point. This app is a personal spare-time project to help me learn some modern web development techniques and exercise my new skills.

ClueLogic is designed specifically to work with Clue: Master Detective. It does not work with any other version of Clue.

ClueLogic is not in any way affiliated with the makers of Clue.

## How does it work?

ClueLogic uses Python for the logic, unittest to test the logic, Flask to serve up the web pages, Jinja to construct the pages from HTML, CSS with Bootstrap for the formatting, Javascript for form validation, and PythonAnywhere for hosting.

## How to run it

To run this on a local Flask server, just run application.py and go to the usual localhost IP in your web browser.  You need to have Flask and flask_session installed.
