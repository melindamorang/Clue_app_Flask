    <h1>Welcome to ClueLogic!</h1>

    <p class="lead">ClueLogic is a web app to accompany the game Clue: Master Detective.
        It uses python code to track players' guesses and derive useful information
        from them, helping you figure out whodunnit, where, and with what faster
        than the other players.
    </p>

    <p>Yes, this is sort of a cheating app.  Your Clue: Master Detective games may
        not be as fun if you actually use this app.  That's okay because it's not
        really the point. This app is a personal spare-time project to help me
        learn some modern web development techniques and exercise my new skills.

    </p>

    <p>ClueLogic is designed specifically to work with Clue: Master Detective.
        It does not work with any other version of Clue.

    <p>ClueLogic is not in any way affiliated with the makers of Clue.</p>
